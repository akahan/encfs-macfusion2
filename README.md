### EncFS Plugin for macfusion2

This fork is an update to the EncFS Macfusion2 plugin by Tobias Haeberle
http://code.google.com/p/encfs-macfusion2/

I wanted to accomplish three things.

1. I wanted an option in the Plugin's GUI to specify arbitrary command line options.
2. Get it to compile
3. Get it on github (to avoid interacting with google code)

This allowed me to to be able to add `-oallow_other` and `-olocal` so that spotlight correctly indexes the mounts in Max OSX Lion 10.7.x)

That's all.
